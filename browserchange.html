<h1>68. Is there any need to change the web browsers to support HTML5</h1>
<body>
    <p>No need to change the web browsers to support htmls<br>
     <br>   ❗ When You Might Need to Update or Change Your Browser
        You only might need to change browsers if:
        <br> You’re using an old version of Internet Explorer (especially IE8 or below).
        <br> Your browser hasn't been updated in years and doesn’t support newer HTML5 
        elements or APIs (like  local storage, etc.).</p>
        <pre><code><video>, <audio>, <canvas></code></pre>
<br>
<p>Modern Browsers Already Support HTML5
    HTML5 has been around since 2014, and all major browsers have supported it for years. These include:
    
    Google Chrome<br>
    
    Mozilla Firefox<br>
    
    Microsoft Edge<br>
    
    Safari<br>
    
    Opera<br>
    
    If you're using any reasonably recent version of these, you’re good to go.</p>
