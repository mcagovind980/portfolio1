<h1 class="g">CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways
</h1>
<ul type="dsce"><li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li></ul>
    <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file
    </li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<mark>in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles</mark> , because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li></ul>

<p class="p">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<h6 class="p">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</h6>
<br>
<p class="p">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
