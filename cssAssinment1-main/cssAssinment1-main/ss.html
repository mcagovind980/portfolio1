    <h1>This is a CSS Assignment</h1>

    <h2><i>What is CSS ?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><del>CSS is not necessary</del><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><a href="#">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="spaced">Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
        <li class="spaced">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li class="spaced">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="spaced">The most common way to add CSS is to keep the style in external CSS files.<mark>in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles,</mark>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
        ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special url to link directly to an elememt and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p><i>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied applied</i>
